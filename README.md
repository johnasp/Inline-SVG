#Summary 

This is a grunt file which runs tasks to process a folder of SVG files (generally icons) and converts them into a single definitions file <def>.  It also processes PNG versions of the SVG files at 16x16 and 32x32.

##How to use

1. Install Node on your computer (if not already running): https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Create folder on your computer like 'icons' or similar.
3. Go to this repo https://github.com/johnasp/Inline-SVG-system-with-Defs and download the package.json and gruntfile.js files into the folder you created in step 2 above. 
4. Install all the project dependies with this command:  npm -install 
5. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder.  TIP - I type 'cd' in terminal and then locate the folder in Finder and drap and drop this folder in terminal which adds the full path in terminal so you dont need to type it all in.
